## About

This repository contains my projects for Habib University's LEAP Program Coding Club. As a student in the LEAP Program, I am demonstrating the skills and knowledge I've acquired through these projects.

## Projects

### 1. Weather Graphing App
I have completed a weather graphing app that visualizes temperature data over time. The app is functional but still requires some finishing touches.

### 2. Upcoming Projects
I have several other projects planned but have not started them yet. Stay tuned for updates as I begin working on these projects.

## Feedback
Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to learn and grow through these projects.
